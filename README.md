On your Mac try installing `portaudio` and `elasticsearch` using `homebrew` through the below commands in the terminal:
```
brew install portaudio
brew install elasticsearch
```

We also install some python libraries such as `SpeechRecognition` which is a library for performing speech recognition, `elasticsearch` which provides common ground for all elasticsearch related codes in Python, and `pyaudio` which is a the cross-platform audio input/output stream library. The aforementioned libraries can be installed using the pip command as:
```
pip install elasticsearch
pip install pyaudio
pip install SpeechRecognition
```
